####  - `ARCS` Automated Reactions for CO<sub>2</sub> Storage

[https://github.com/badw/arcs.git](https://github.com/badw/arcs.git)

`arcs` is a package to aid research into impurity reactions within the CO<sub>2</sub> capture stream. `arcs` achieves this by stochastically sampling a reaction network setup using DFT calculated data. 
This project was in collaboration with Equinor, Total Energies, and Shell. 

A modified and forked version is provided at [https://github.com/equinor/arcs](https://github.com/equinor/arcs)
